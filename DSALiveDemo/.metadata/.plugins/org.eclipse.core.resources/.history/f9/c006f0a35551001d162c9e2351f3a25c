/*A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of nodes (vertices) and edges (edges can be known as 
 * lines or arcs). 
 * We use graphs to solve real-world problems usually having to do with networks, because we use the graph
 * to represent the network. For example we can use graphs to model networks such as telephone networksa, 
 * circuit networks, 
 * neighborhoods (how the roads in a city connect), etc. 
 * Graphs are also used in social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. For example: each person is represented 
 * as a node (vertex), and each node structure can contain info such as their id, name, locale, etc. 
 * A graph can be cyclic or acyclic
