/*
 * What is a tree: 
 * A Tree is a type of graph composed of nodes (object) and edges (edcges are what connect your nodes to each other)
 * Main properties of a tree: 
 * - Acyclic - a node path does not connect to the same node in a cycle
 * - There is a path from the root node to any node
 * - There are n - 1 edges in your tree
 * - Each node will have xactly one parent node, with the exception of the root node
 * 
 * A few types of trees: 
 * - General trees
 * - Binary tree : a binary tree will have between 0 - 2 child nodes for each node 
 * - Binary search tree : is organized in a way (sorted) where the smaller values are organized to the left
 * and the larger values are organized to the right of the tree. 
 * 
 * all descendants < root < all descendants 
 * 
 * - N-ary tree : Depending on the value of N, you will have between 0 - N child nodes per node
 * 
 * TreeSet: is an implementation of the SortedSet interface which uses a tree for storage. It is a binary search tree,
 * which follows natural ordering. There can be no duplicates in TreeSet, nor in binary search trees in general. 
 *
