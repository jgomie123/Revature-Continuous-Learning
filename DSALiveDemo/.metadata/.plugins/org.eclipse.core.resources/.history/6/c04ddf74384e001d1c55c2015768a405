/*A stack is also a linear data structure that follows a particular order of adding or removing elments
 * A stack is FILO (first in last out) 
 * 
 * We can use stacks in a variety of ways when we code - for exmaple, we use stacks to implement parsers, we can 
 * use it for expression evaluation, and some algorithms as well. 
 * 
 * One real world application for stack is when reversing the order of a string letter by letter; another exmaple
 * could be an undo or redo function of a text editor
