/*Recursion: recursion is when a method calls itself
 * for example: 
 * public static void foo(){
 * 		foo();
 * }
 * 
 * The above method will continue to call itself over and over
 * and adding one frame on top of another in the stack until we get a StackOverflowError.
 * WHen it comes to leveraging recursion in our code, we do need to add a condition for the method
 * to be invoked - this condition is called a "Base Case."
