/*Merge Sort: 
 * Merge sort uses the divide and conquer strategy for sorting elements. 
 * It recursively breaks down a problem into 21 or more sub problems intil they become simple enough
 * to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution
 * to the original problem. 
 * 
 * The merge sort algorithm looks something like this: 
 * **arr = array that is being sorted
 * **left = first index's position
 * **right = last index's position
 * 
 * 
 *
